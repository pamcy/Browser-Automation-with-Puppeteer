# Browser-Automation-with-Puppeteer
**Puppeteer** is a Node library API that allows us to control headless Chrome. There’s so much you can do with **Puppeteer**, I will use it to get snapshot of a web page and scrape Github.

## Coding

### Take a fullpage snapshot

Set default viewport size to 1440 x 900, then it will loop through 3 links and generate fullpage website screenshots.

### Scrape Github's 20 most forked Puppeteer repos

Login to Github to extract top 20 most forked `Puppeteer` repos and store these data as a `json` file.

[Here’s the final result!](https://github.com/pamcy/Browser-Automation-with-Puppeteer/blob/master/github-results.json)
